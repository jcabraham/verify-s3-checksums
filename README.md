# Verify Checksums

This is a simple Python script which verifies an md5sum of local files against the md5sum calculated by AWS when that file is uploaded to S3.

## The Bad News
A common research use case is to store files in an AWS S3 bucket. Often this same bucket is made accessible to an ec2 server using File Gateway and/or SFTP clients can be enabled via Transfer Family, which also NFS mounts this S3 bucket.

To make an s3 bucket look like a regular NFS mount, it caches a lot of data on the File Gateway or Transfer Family server. CACHING IS SLOW. To calculate a checksum on an NFS mounted bucket like so:

```bash
$ md5sum /my-bucket/my-path/my-giant-dir/*
```

Requires that the cache load the contents of every file into the cache, just to calculate the checksum.

## The Good News
The md5sum is ALREADY calculated for you. The AWS S3 API calculates the md5sum after the file upload finishes on the AWS side. It stores that data in the "ETag" field of the S3Object. We can retrieve that very efficiently using the API.


## Suggested Workflow

### 0. Install this thing
```bash

$ git clone git@github.com:jcabraham/verify-checksums.git

```


### 1. Transfer your files
Do this however you wish, but I like using RCLONE to do transfers: it's extremely efficient and easy to configure. An example config for IMPACC:

To use RCLONE, install it via brew (Mac), yum/apt (Linux), or the web (Windows). Copy this example to the following path:

```bash
~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

```
[impacc]
type = sftp
host = [impacc sftp host]
user = [my_username]
key_file = [path_to_my_private_key]
set_modtime = false
```

NOTE: you must add 
```bash
set_modtime = false
```

or you'll get errors.

Then you can do things like the following:

```bash
rclone sync ./my-giant-dir/ impacc:/my-giant-dir
```

### 2. Verify your upload checksums

The provided verify-checksums.py Python script will create a dictionary of md5sums for your local files and compare them to the md5sums (ETags) of the same files in the S3 bucket.  

```bash
$ python3 verify-checksums.py check-directory --local-path ./my-giant-dir --remote-path Boston/my-giant-dir/ --warn-missing
```

You can also use the output of md5sum as the local source:
```bash

```

  Iterate over files in a directory, generate md5sum for each and compare to
  sum on s3

Options:
  --local-path PATH   Local directory path

                      "*" (all)
  --bucket TEXT       Bucket name (e.g. "impacc-study", not "s3://impacc-
                      study"  [required]

  --debug             Turn on debugging.
  --help              Show this message and exit.
```

### Check a directory (everything correct)
```bash
# Upload some test files with rclone
$ rclone sync ./my-giant-dir/ impacc:/my-giant-dir

#(no output, successful upload)

# Verify checksums
$ python3 verify-checksums.py check-directory --local-path ./my-giant-dir --remote-path Boston/my-giant-dir/ --warn-missing
Verifying ./my-giant-dir/* checksums against s3://impacc-study/Boston/my-giant-dir/
Warn if files missing on s3: True
Verified 3 files, 0 errors.

# Verify checksums, turn on debugging info
$ python3 verify-checksums.py check-directory --local-path ./my-giant-dir --remote-path Boston/my-giant-dir/ --warn-missing --debug
Verifying ./my-giant-dir/* checksums against s3://impacc-study/Boston/my-giant-dir/

Verified 3 files, 0 errors.
```

### Modify a local file, check directory again
```bash
$ echo foo >> ./my-giant-dir/foo.txt

$ python3 verify-checksums.py check-directory --local-path ./my-giant-dir --remote-path Boston/my-giant-dir/ --warn-missing --debug
Verifying ./my-giant-dir/* checksums against s3://impacc-study/Boston/my-giant-dir/

Verified 3 files, 1 errors.
```

### Check against a file previously generated by md5sum or rclone

```bash
# run md5sum manually, save to file
$ cd ./my-giant-dir
$ md5sum * >> ../local-checksums.txt
$ cd ..
$ cat ./local-checksums.txt
c157a79031e1c40f85931829bc5fc552  bar.txt
